📧 AI Email Assistant (Chrome Extension)

The AI Email Assistant is a Chrome extension that enhances Gmail with AI-powered reply generation. It seamlessly integrates an “AI Reply” button and a Tone Selector (Professional, Casual, Friendly) directly into Gmail’s compose toolbar.

With a single click, it analyzes the context of the received email and generates a contextually relevant, well-written response in your chosen tone — saving time and improving communication efficiency.

The extension communicates with a Spring Boot backend powered by the Gemini API, ensuring intelligent, natural, and personalized email drafting within seconds.
